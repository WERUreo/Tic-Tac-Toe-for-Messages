# Tic Tac Toe for Messages
-------
This is a simple iMessage app that lets the user play a game of Tic Tac Toe directly in the Messages app on iOS.  I wrote this for a presentation I gave recently at the [Orlando iOS Developers Group Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-iOS-Developer-Group).

As I had mentioned during the presentation, this app borrows heavily from both Apple's sample [Ice Cream Builder](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/IceCreamBuilder/Introduction/Intro.html) app that they demonstrated at WWDC 2016, and by an app created by [Shinobi Controls](https://www.shinobicontrols.com).  Full links available below.

So my Keynote presentation that went along with this demo app didn't really have a whole lot of information, so what I'll do is just provide links to the resources I used to help me prepare this presentation and app, because those are really the best references you can use to get started with creating your own iMessage apps.

Apple's Ice Cream Builder Sample App (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/IceCreamBuilder/Introduction/Intro.html)

Shinobi Controls iOS 10 Day by Day - Day 1 - Messages (https://www.shinobicontrols.com/blog/ios-10-day-by-day-day-1-messages)  NOTE: This Shinobi Controls blog was my primary inspiration for doing this iMessage app.  Their blog provides a really fantastic introduction into how to get started creating iMessage apps, and I highly recommend you give this a read.  Their Battleships app was basically the starting point for my own Tic Tac Toe app, and as such you'll see a lot of code that I more or less pulled right out of their sample project.  You should also read the rest of their iOS 10 Day by Day series, where they talk about more of the cool new features of iOS 10.

Thanks to everyone that attended the meetup to hear my presentation on this.  I hope, if nothing else, I inspired you to try making an iMessage app of your own.  I see a lot of potential use cases for iMessage apps, and now's a great time to get your ideas out there in the world!
